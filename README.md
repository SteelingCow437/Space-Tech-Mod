Space-Tech-Mod

A mod about space and tech, for 1.20.1

Space stuff won't be here for quite a while,
as this is my first mod and I want to make sure that I make everything as vanilla-feeling
as possible and easy to understand while still maintaining a high level of technicality that
you would expect from a tech mod.

With that being said, here is my current roadmap:

1. Finish the sculk dimension (so I can learn how to mess with biomes, dimensions, and structures)
2. Create a redstone-like power network or just implement RF (TBD)
3. Implement a fluid system or just use ForgeFluids (TBD)
4. Begin experimenting with new biomes and structures
5. Create a system for rockets
6. Create planets
7. IDK what comes after that to be honest. I don't expect to get this far for quite a long time.
