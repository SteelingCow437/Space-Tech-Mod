Space-Tech-Mod

A mod about space and tech, for 1.21 and beyond

Space stuff won't be here for quite a while,
as this is my first mod and I want to make sure that I make everything as vanilla-feeling
as possible and easy to understand while still maintaining a high level of technicality that
you would expect from a tech mod.

If you see something that either looks gross, works poorly, or just needs improvement, make a pull request
or open up an issue, so I can know what's going on. Things will be broked/janky, I'm an amateur programmer
and modder, so bear with me here.

FAQ:

Versioning structure: NeoforgeVersion.MajorModVersion.MinorModVersion.CommitNumber

"What versions?"  1.21 Neoforged, as of now. I'll update to the latest versions of everything as soon as
I humanly can.

"Fabric? Quilt? Regular Forge?" No. By all means, port them if you know how, but don't bother asking ME to do it.

"Hotel?"  Trivago.

"Can you add X?"  If it's a good suggestion, maybe. Don't put suggestions in the issues tab, that's
for issues, not for suggestions. If you want something, make a pull request, or make it a really good
suggestion.

"When will X be done?"  IDK. I work at my own pace. I have school, a job, and a life to live, and all of those come first.

"I hate you and this mod is stupid!"  Then don't download it.

"How do I make X?"  Use the mod Just Enough Items / JEI / whatever it's called now.
If it's not in there, chances are you either have to find it or it's made at a special
crafting station. Recipes for everything will be on the wiki in the GitHub page.

"How do I download it?"  Download the JAR file from the "Releases" tab and put it in your
mods folder. There are no dependencies, but I recommend some performance mods, as Mojang doesn't know how to code, and
neither do I.
